TMDB Data Analysis Project

A PDF with the key findings of the data analysis and prediction analysis
can be found at:
https://github.com/wildanwildan94/TMDB-Data-Analysis-Prediction-Inference/blob/master/TMDB_Revenue_Analysis_Project_C.pdf

The analysis and code is best viewed with Google Colaboratory Notebooks, as
given by the links:
